        "Spatial-temporal graph modeling is a technique used to analyze and understand complex systems, particularly those with varying behaviors across both spatial (how different components or nodes are related in space) and temporal (how these relationships change over time) dimensions. With the advent of graph neural networks, spatial-temporal graph modeling has received increased attention due to its applicability in diverse problem spaces, encompassing areas like traffic speed forecasting, taxi demand prediction, human action recognition, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, capturing spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously can be challenging. Recent research has explored integrating graph convolution networks (GCN) into either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, these approaches have drawbacks. The GCN assumes that the predefined graph structure accurately represents genuine dependency relationships, overlooking nuanced situations where connections do not imply true inter-dependencies. Also, capturing temporal dependencies with RNNs or CNNs can be slow and computationally inefficient when considering longer sequences. \n",

        "We introduce the Graph WaveNet framework to tackle these shortcomings and effectively represent Spatial-temporal graphs using Graph Wavenet Framework to forecast the future."

This is an example of a static graph with temporal signals.  The graph structure represents the regional geography, which is fixed, while the node features represent the number of cases of the disease, which varies over time. Further information on the dataset and its significance can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08100.\n",
